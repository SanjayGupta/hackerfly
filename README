get hacking!

ubuntu 8.04.0+ ; rubygems 1.3 ; rails 2.2.2 ~~>
 

First things first, you first need to upgrade the gems to 1.3 to install rails 2.2.2

sudo gem --version sudo gem update --system

1) When you see the error code: /usr/bin/gem:23: uninitialized constant Gem::GemRunner (NameError)

So the solution is to add require ‘rubygems/gem_runner’ line to /usr/bin/gem . If you don’t know how to do this or if you are a newbie, don’t worry, I am explaining it below .

Step 1 : Go to the terminal and type the following

$ cd /usr/bin/

This will move you to the folder /usr/bin/

Step 2 : Type the following command to open up file in text editor

$ sudo pico gem and enter your password

Step 3 : Add the line ‘rubygems/gem_runner’ to the gem file that opens up after Step 2 ,

Add the line before require ‘rubygems’ Step 4 : Press Ctrl+X to save the file and exit.

=====================================



If you are getting errors:

/usr/bin/gem:10:Warning: Gem::manage_gems is deprecated and will be removed on or after March 2009. /usr/bin/gem:23: uninitialized constant Gem::GemRunner (NameError)

Here's the hack:

sudo pico /usr/bin/gem

Change the top of the file to look like this:

require 'rubygems' require 'rubygems/gem_runner'
Gem.manage_gems

Then you could proceed to installing RAILS:

gem install rails

or

sudo gem install rails

=======================================

now we are ready to get ready.

1)download tarball
2)rake hackerfly:go
3)insert password for sudo if requested...
4)rake db:migrate
5)./script/server

FIN
